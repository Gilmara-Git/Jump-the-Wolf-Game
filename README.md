## About
This project was born based on the **1st** challenge that 3 colleagues and I had to conclude at the *Space Squad* mentorship program. On this 1st challenge, we needed to find a simple open source project and contribute do it somehow.

## Project chosen
We have chosen the [Dino Game](https://github.com/belatoledo/dino-game) project and we added a **score** and a **blinking line** on the screen indicating to press **enter** to start the game. 
The results are available at [Dino Game improved](https://github.com/Gilmara-Git/dino)

## Practical learning - Jump of the Wolf
- First, I created a new style to the game using CSS3. 
- Then, I started to explore the JS code behind the scenes and I realized that I was using the "keypress" event for the first time. Then this event is being passed as a parameter to another function in order to start the game. 
- The startGame function calls another one - StartScore which uses a setInterval to start the score and keeps repeating at a certain interval time. 
- Then I learned how to get a **CSS style applied to a compoment** and then **its property value** in order apply conditions to the game. 

 - Example: parseInt(window.getComputedStyle(wolf).getPropertyValue("top")) 


## Languages / Technologies used
